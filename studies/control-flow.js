/*
 - The flow of JavaScript runs from top to bottom, so order matters when
   working with code!
 - an exception in this rule really only occurs for select moments, those
   being when you run a function that was earlier declared in the code, or when
   you have a loop that continues to run though the loop so long the loop is
   able to run.
 - JavaScript is a single-threaded code language, which means that while it can 
   store objects and variables to memory, it can only actively work on one thing
   at a time. You have to keep that in mind when you code, or else it'll fall
   to pieces at runtime.

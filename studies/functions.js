/* 
 - Functions are on a strange middle ground between datatype and operator,
   meaning that they can be stored like data, but they in and of themselves
   have code that is acted on whenever called upon.
 - Functions are created with the keyword 'function', and can be given a name.
   All functions `can` be given parameters, to allow for more dynamic usage when
   called upon at runtime.
